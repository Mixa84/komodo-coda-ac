# Coda

Coda is a new cryptocurrency protocol with a lightweight, constant sized blockchain.

Please see our [developer README](README-dev.md) if you are interested in building coda from source code.

We have a [Discord server]( https://discord.gg/ShKhA7J)! Please come by if you
need help or have questions. You might also be interested in the [OCaml
Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/cCYQbqN), for general OCaml help.
