O(1) Labs is a small, well-funded startup aiming to develop the first cryptocurrency protocol that can deliver on the promise of supporting real-world applications and widespread use. Our team is based in San Francisco, and we are funded by top investors (including Polychain, Metastable, Max Levchin, and Naval Ravikant).

Achieving mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies is a design challenge as much as it is a technical one. We're looking for an inventive, empathetic designer who's inspired to realize the vision of making trustless, rapid, and nearly free transactions accessible to everyone.

Our lead designer will have the following responsibilities:

- Collaborate on the high-level strategy and branding of the protocol, developing realistic user profiles and ensuring they're kept in mind as we develop our products
- Prototype and explore novel applications, iterate on user feedback, and deliver excellent products
- Design and test wireframes, user flows, and layouts for our website, wallet, and other applications

This is a chance to join a small, collaborative team and have a ton of independence while working on fascinating problems that span visual and information design, branding, computing, and sociology. We expect this designer to be deeply impactful to developing and actualizing the vision for the protocol and the surrounding ecosystem. We also offer competitive compensation both in salary and equity as well as top-of-the-market benefits.

The ideal candidate:

- Has an understanding of the principles behind user interfaces, a sensitivity to color and typography, and a keen eye for pixel-perfect design
- Can quickly develop prototypes and specifications for novel designs with minimal supervision
- Can write maintainable, modern HTML/CSS
- Has a genuine interest in cryptocurrencies, and wants to develop applications that bring them to a broad audience

There are no hard requirements and we're more interested in learning about your individual background.
