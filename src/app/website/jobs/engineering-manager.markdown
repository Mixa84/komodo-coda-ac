O(1) Labs is aiming to develop the first cryptocurrency protocol that can deliver on the promise of supporting real-world applications and widespread use. Our team is based in San Francisco, and we are funded by top investors (including Polychain, Metastable, Max Levchin, and Naval Ravikant).

We're developing Coda Protocol, a cryptocurrency that compresses the blockchain from hundreds of gigabytes down to the size of a few tweets. It can scale to thousands of transactions per second and millions of users while remaining so decentralized even old cellphones can act as fully verifying nodes. We're seeking a technical engineering manager who can prioritize and collaborate across diverse engineering disciplines, while remaining an empathetic and caring mentor to engineers with diverse perspectives.

Engineering managers will:

* Help decide who works on what and when, minimizing unnecessary process and developing nurturing environments where engineers feel empowered to contribute their best work
* Collaborate broadly to design well-informed engineering roadmaps
* Contribute to the project technically as well as provide impactful mentoring

This is a chance to join and guide a small, collaborative team and have a ton of independence while working on fascinating cross-disciplinary problems that span cryptography, programming languages, functional programming, networking, and traditional product engineering. We also offer competitive compensation both in salary and equity as well as top-of-the-market benefits.

Ideal candidates will be interested in:

* Technical leadership
* Mentorship
* Cryptography
* Distributed systems
* Functional programming

There are no hard requirements and we're more interested in learning about your individual background.

We are committed to building a diverse, inclusive company. People of color, LGBTQ individuals, women, and people with disabilities are strongly encouraged to apply.
