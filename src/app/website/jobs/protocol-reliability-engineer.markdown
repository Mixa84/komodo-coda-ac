O(1) Labs is aiming to develop the first cryptocurrency protocol that can deliver on the promise of supporting real-world applications and widespread use. Our team is based in San Francisco, and we are funded by top investors (including Polychain, Metastable, Max Levchin, and Naval Ravikant).

We're bringing Coda Protocol to market, a cryptocurrency that compresses the blockchain from hundreds of gigabytes down to the size of a few tweets. It can scale to thousands of transactions per second and millions of users while remaining decentralized enough for cellphones to be fully verifying nodes.

We’re working on technologies with the potential to reimagine social structures.

We believe it’s important to incorporate diverse perspectives from conception through realization.

This is a chance to join a small, collaborative team and have a ton of independence while working on fascinating cross-disciplinary problems that span cryptography, engineering, product design, economics, and sociology. We also offer competitive compensation both in salary and equity as well as top-of-the-market benefits.

We’re hiring engineers to work on a bunch of exciting projects, including:

* Advancing our testing environment that can simulate network performance with thousands of machines across variable network conditions
* Creating the core machine images we use to streamline onboarding new network nodes
* Developing sophisticated diagnostic systems that continuously monitor network performance and provide visibility into network health
* Designing robust, self-healing systems that ensure the health and stability of a fledgling cryptocurrency network under intense network loads or highly adversarial environments

No prior cryptocurrency experience is necessary.

Ideal candidates will be interested in any of:

* Cloud infrastructure tools like terraform, packer, boto
* Package management (nix, deb, rpm)
* CI/CD tooling and workflows
* Functional programming
* Security
* Distributed systems
* Cryptography
* Cryptocurrency

There are no hard requirements and we're more interested in learning about your individual background.

If you'd be interested in talking further, please get in touch by sending an email with your resume and the subject "Protocol Reliability Engineer Applicant" to [jobs@o1labs.org](mailto:jobs@o1labs.org?subject="Protocol Reliability Engineer Applicant").

We are committed to building a diverse, inclusive company. People of color, LGBTQ individuals, women, and people with disabilities are strongly encouraged to apply.
