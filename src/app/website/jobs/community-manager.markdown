O(1) Labs is aiming to develop the first cryptocurrency protocol that can deliver on the promise of supporting real-world applications and widespread use. Our team is based in San Francisco, and we are funded by top investors (including Polychain, Metastable, Max Levchin, and Naval Ravikant).

Cryptocurrency projects represent a new way to organize communities, marrying the accessibility of open-source projects with the ambitious shared visions of traditional startups. We're looking for someone who wants to explore what's possible this space by developing a vibrant, global community of experts, developers, and enthusiasts.

Our community manager will have the following responsibilities:

* Act as a well-informed representative of the community in internal discussions to provide input on major decisions
* Be our ambassador to the outside world, managing our relationships with the press, our partners, and our social media users
* Develop and oversee the community, from designing creative proposals to executing them and monitoring their success
* Hone our brand and message, translating a high level vision to professional quality materials

This is a chance to join a small, collaborative team and have a ton of independence while working on fascinating problems that span economics, marketing, computing, and sociology. We also offer competitive compensation both in salary and equity as well as top-of-the-market benefits.

The ideal candidate:

* Has a genuine interest in cryptocurrencies, understands and can clearly communicate how they work to a variety of audiences
* Is a critical thinker who can grasp novel protocol designs and is willing to learn about fields relevant to cryptocurrencies, like cryptography, distributed systems, and economics
* Is an excellent writer and persuasive speaker

There are no hard requirements and we're more interested in learning about your individual background.
